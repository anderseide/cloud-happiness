# Creating a new policy from template

If you want deploy policies using PowerShell, have a peak at this project https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples

If you want to just play around with it, combined by learning to use Graph, I favor using the Microsoft Graph Explorer directly. Just remember to activat the needed [permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference).
